# Opioid Epidemic Modeling 
# for COMAP MCM 2019 Problem C
Our team constructs a model based on the SIR model for epidemics to ex-
plain the trends of opioid use in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania. This model - the SIRI model - is a system of three linear ordinary
differential equations describing the transition between non-users, users, and sober
individuals. We incorporate elements of the SIRS model into our model, allow-
ing individuals to transition between a user and sober state. However, once one
becomes a user, they can never transition back to a non-user state.
